## PROJECT PURPOSE AND GOAL

I wanted to build a cool blog that has a admin panel and all, so I started working in this. I wanted to build a blog that was visually appealing to both the users and the admin. I also wanted a blog with little or no difficulties, from uploading pictures to writing the actually article.

## LESSON LEARNT

Through this project, I learnt about how to organize my code for easy access. Redux was an obvious option for state management has it involved a lot of movement from the frontend to the database.

I was able to learn more about MongoDB and Redux state, I learnt about react showdown which is used to covert markdown text into HTML and vis versa and also how to create a dark mode version. From this project, I also learnt how to upload images and files on mongoDB and retrieve it. You can read my article on how to do it
